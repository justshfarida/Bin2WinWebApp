            <h1>About Bin2Win</h1>
            <p>
                Bin2Win is an interactive recycling program that rewards users for disposing of plastic waste responsibly. 
                Our goal is to make recycling an easy and rewarding habit while promoting a cleaner and more sustainable future.
            </p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Users participate by scanning a QR code on designated recycling bins. They then answer a short survey 
                about the product and brand. Our system uses smart text suggestions to prevent spelling errors that could affect 
                machine learning recognition.
            </p>

            <h2>Ensuring Data Accuracy</h2>
            <p>
                Bin2Win leverages a machine learning model to verify data accuracy, ensuring that the brands exist and the plastic 
                content is correctly identified. This process makes recycling more efficient and beneficial for all stakeholders.
            </p>
